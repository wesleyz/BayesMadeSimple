Problem: students sign up to participate in a community service
project.  Some fraction, q, of the students who sign up actually
participate, and of those some fraction, r, report back.

Given a sample of students who sign up and the number who report
back, we can estimate the product q*r, but don't learn much about
q and r separately.

If we can get a smaller sample of students where we know who
participated and who reported, we can use that to improve the
estimates of q and r.

And we can use that to compute the posterior distribution of the
number of students who participated.
